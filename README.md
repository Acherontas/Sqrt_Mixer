# Sqrt_Mixer
Just a mix of actions to find the square root

its doesnt work for all the numbers
it mix a bunch of numbers
from user input and 
others from the internal calculation
of lower values of square roots from 
the digit summary but it has to be two 

it doesnt work well
u need to guess a bit
u will have an approximation 
a window of opportunity 
and a lot of manual number writing

all of these will be mixed in a wonderful 
way of the basic mathematical addition multiplication division and removal

just like a bet system 
u can try it at home :)

u can modify it freely 
u cant sell it θα πινετε νερακι forever ever
